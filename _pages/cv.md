Previously used to work with a blockchain startup in their early phase where we built data pipelines, applied natural language processing techniques, identified trading patterns and trained machine learning models to trade on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.

Additionally, during my internship at RR Donnelley, I worked with the direct mail marketing research team to increase the profit by targeting customers for diverse domain clients (such as Healthcare, Insurance, Finance, Retail Stores etc.) through applying machine learning models, statistical modeling and data visualization on real-world problems.

Also, I graduated with a master of science in Information Systems from Illinois State University specialized in Machine Learning, Data Science and Web Development.
