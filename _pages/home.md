### Background
I am currently working at [Rakuten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakuten) ([Rakuten Institute of Technology](https://rit.rakuten.co.jp/)  - R&D Dept) as a Research Scientist where I use deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning to solve finance, cybersecurity and e-commerce related research problems.

Previously used to work with a blockchain startup in their early phase where we built data pipelines, applied natural language processing techniques, identified trading patterns and trained machine learning models to trade on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc.

Additionally, during my internship at [RR Donnelley](https://www.rrd.com/), I worked with the direct mail marketing research team to increase the profit by targeting customers for diverse domain clients (such as Healthcare, Insurance, Finance, Retail Stores etc.) through applying machine learning models, statistical modeling and data visualization on real-world problems.

Also, I graduated with a master of science in Information Systems from [Illinois State University](https://illinoisstate.edu/) specialized in Machine Learning, Data Science and Web Development.

### Research Projects
#### Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits:
Develop a contextual bandit model to optimize Ad banners on Rakuten e-commerce website for tens of millions of users based on users’ historical purchase data and historical interactions with banners
Write production code to be used in real-time low latency application and performed thorough testing

#### Anomaly Detection in Security:
Develop a user and entity analysis (UEBA) tool using clustering and multi-modal (CNN & LSTM) learning to detect malware and anomalies in tens of thousands of Rakuten employee’s terminals from network text logs

#### Credit Scoring:
Increased the approval rate of credit card merchant customers by 5% by developing a credibility scoring model and segmentation of merchants that led to an increase in revenue of millions of dollars
Lead a team of engineers for the backend development and design different system architecture diagrams

#### Market Trading:
Gained more than 7% ROI / year in daily trading of products such as forex currency pairs, bonds, and indexes by developing end-to-end machine learning models (LSTM & Traditional ML) based on historical market macroeconomics data for assets under management (AUM) of tens of millions of dollars

### Patents
