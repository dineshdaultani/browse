## Background
I am currently working at Rakuten ([Rakuten Institute of Technology](https://rit.rakuten.co.jp/)  - R&D Dept) as a Research Scientist where I use deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning to solve finance, cybersecurity and e-commerce related research problems. I work under the supervision of [Bruno Charron](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=klbU-o4AAAAJ&hl=en) in the Intelligence lab at Rakuten Institute of Technology (RIT). 
<br /><br />

## Research Interests
My research interests include computer vision, machine learning and reinforcement learning.
<br /><br />

## Research Projects at Rakuten
**Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits**
- Develop a contextual bandit model to optimize Ad banners on Rakuten e-commerce website for tens of millions of users based on users’ historical purchase data and historical interactions with banners
- Write production code to be used in real-time low latency application and performed thorough testing

**Anomaly Detection in Security**
- Develop a user and entity analysis (UEBA) tool using clustering and multi-modal (CNN & LSTM) learning to detect malware and anomalies in tens of thousands of Rakuten employee’s terminals from network text logs

**Credit Scoring**
- Increased the approval rate of credit card merchant customers by 5% by developing a credibility scoring model and segmentation of merchants that led to an increase in revenue of millions of dollars
- Lead a team of engineers for the backend development and design different system architecture diagrams

**Market Trading**
- Gained more than 7% ROI / year in daily trading of products such as forex currency pairs, bonds, and indexes by developing end-to-end machine learning models (LSTM & Traditional ML) based on historical market macroeconomics data for assets under management (AUM) of tens of millions of dollars
