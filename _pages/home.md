## Background
I am currently a Visiting Researcher at Polytechnique Montreal specializing in designing efficient neural network architectures. Moreover, I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. from the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokodai) in the Dept. of Systems and Control Engineering at [Okutomi Tanaka Lab](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/index.shtml). My primary supervisor is Professor [Masayuki Tanaka](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/~mtanaka/), and I am working closely with Professor [Masatoshi Okutomi](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/mem/mxo/okutomi.html). 

Previously, I worked at Woven Planet Holdings as a Data Scientist, where I was part of the Self-Driving Recognition/Perception AD/ADAS team from 2021 to 2022. At Woven, I work on research problems related to few-shot object detection, scene tags image classification, and road marking recognition. I worked at Rakuten ([Rakuten Institute of Technology](https://rit.rakuten.co.jp/)  - R&D Dept) as a Research Scientist for 3.5 years, where I used deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning to solve computer vision, finance, cybersecurity, and e-commerce related research problems. In Rakuten, I worked under the supervision of [Bjorn Stenger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=plhjgHUAAAAJ&hl=en),  [Bruno Charron](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=klbU-o4AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Mitsuru Nakazawa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TLQD7yUAAAAJ&hl=ja). During my master's, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. James Wolf](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/James-R.-Wolf/2543949) for my master's project.
