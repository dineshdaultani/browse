## Background
I am currently pursuing Ph.D. from the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokodai) in Dept. of Systems and Control Engineering at [Okutomi Tanaka Lab](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/index.shtml). My main supervisor is professor [Masayuki Tanaka](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/~mtanaka/) and I am working closely with the professor [Masatoshi Okutomi](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/mem/mxo/okutomi.html). 

Additionally, I am currently working at Rakuten ([Rakuten Institute of Technology](https://rit.rakuten.co.jp/)  - R&D Dept) as a Research Scientist where I use deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning to solve computer vision, finance, cybersecurity and e-commerce related research problems. I work under the supervision of [Bjorn Stenger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=plhjgHUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mitsuru Nakazawa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TLQD7yUAAAAJ&hl=ja). Previously I used to work under the supervision of [Bruno Charron](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=klbU-o4AAAAJ&hl=en) in the Customer group at Rakuten Institute of Technology (RIT). During my master's, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. James Wolf](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/James-R.-Wolf/2543949) for my master's project. 
<br /><br />

## Research Interests
My research interests include computer vision, lifelong learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.
<br /><br />

## Research Projects at Rakuten

**Continuous Taxonomy Learning**
- Develop a lifelong continual learning system for change in the hierarchy of images over time by utilizing recurrent neural networks, GCN, and lifelong learning methods based on hierarchical classification loss functions while baselining the results on Open Images v6 dataset

**Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits**
- Develop a contextual bandit model to optimize Ad banners on Rakuten e-commerce website for tens of millions of users based on users’ historical purchase data and historical interactions with banners
- Write production code to be used in real-time low latency application and performed thorough testing

**Anomaly Detection in Security**
- Develop a user and entity analysis (UEBA) tool using clustering and multi-modal (CNN & LSTM) learning to detect malware and anomalies in tens of thousands of Rakuten employee’s terminals from network text logs

**Credit Scoring**
- Increased the approval rate of credit card merchant customers by 5% by developing a credibility scoring model and segmentation of merchants that led to an increase in revenue of millions of dollars
- Lead a team of engineers for the backend development and design different system architecture diagrams

**Market Trading**
- Gained more than 7% ROI / year in daily trading of products such as forex currency pairs, bonds, and indexes by developing end-to-end machine learning models (LSTM & Traditional ML) based on historical market macroeconomics data for assets under management (AUM) of tens of millions of dollars
