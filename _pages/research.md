## Ph.D. Focus
Real-world images frequently have different corruptions/perturbations, like motion blur, noise (caused by low-light conditions), and digital compression, appearing in various digital versions of images/videos. 
Specifically, computer vision tasks face challenges with image degradation, leading to diminishing model performance or reliability. 
My Ph.D. is focusing on narrowing the performance gap across diverse computer vision tasks between real-world and pristine/clean images.
